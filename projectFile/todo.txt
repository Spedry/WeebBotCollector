## TO DO ##
- test if file doesn't contain virus
- add option for user to choose maxAnimeSize limit
- add option for user to chose from what bot download anime only
- options do download already released anime
- abort unwanted download
# DOWNLOAD ALD RELEASED ANIME #

- use !search "anime name"

# CHOSE OWN BOT #


problem:
// if user wants to download from bot he chose, but:
// 1. the anime selected by him was not released by him selected bot
// 2. he made a grammatical mistake in bot's name
- send message to client app and maybe store the errors/warning messages somewhere

## THOUGHTS ##
- allow downloading multiple animes at once or just one?
- use .properties or just .json?
- how to recognize new release anime, is contains("/MSG") enough?
    options (from bot, contains anime name, other)

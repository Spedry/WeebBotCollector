## TO DO ##

# ANSWER TO THIS #

** You have a DCC pending, Set your client to receive the transfer. Type "/MSG CR-ARUTHA|NEW XDCC CANCEL" to abort the transfer. (30 seconds remaining until timeout)

# DOWNLOAD ALD RELEASED ANIME #

- use !search "anime name"

# CHOSE OWN BOT #

possible bots: samples/bots.txt

problem:
// if user wants to download from bot he chose, but:
// 1. the anime selected by him was not released by him selected bot
// 2. he made a grammatical mistake in bot's name
- send message to client app and maybe store the errors/warning messages somewhere

## THOUGHTS ##
- allow downloading multiple animes at once or just one?
- use .properties or just .json?
- how to recognize new release anime, is contains("/MSG") enough?
    options (from bot, contains anime name, other)

## TO DO ##
- test if file doesn't contain virus
- add option for user to choose maxAnimeSize limit
- add option for user to chose from what bot download anime only
- options do download already released anime
- abort unwanted download
- replace sliced String[] with object
- better way to test if received msg is about releasing new anime
- add option to open last downloaded anime/auto open after downloads end
- change JSON to conf.properties

# ANSWER TO THIS #

** You have a DCC pending, Set your client to receive the transfer. Type "/MSG CR-ARUTHA|NEW XDCC CANCEL" to abort the transfer. (30 seconds remaining until timeout)

# DOWNLOAD OLD RELEASED ANIME #

- use !search "anime name"

# CHOSE OWN BOT #

possible bots: samples/bots.txt

# SEARCH ANIME RETURNS BOT WITH IPV6 #

- if search returns anime from ipv6
    a, remove ipv6, there should be bot names just like bot with ipv6 but without it
    b, just replace it with another bots name
    c, take number at the end and send message to another bot who has the same anime under this number

problem:
// if user wants to download from bot he chose, but:
// 1. the anime selected by him was not released by him selected bot
// 2. he made a grammatical mistake in bot's name
- send message to client app and maybe store the errors/warning messages somewhere

## THOUGHTS ##
- allow downloading multiple animes at once or just one?
- use .properties or just .json?
- how to recognize new release anime, is contains("/MSG") enough?
    options (from bot, contains anime name, other)
